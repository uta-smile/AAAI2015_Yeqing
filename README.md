# Multi-view Spectral Clustering

## Introduction

This repository contains the experiment code in the following paper. 
>Li, Yeqing, Feiping Nie, Heng Huang, and Junzhou Huang. "Large-Scale Multi-View Spectral Clustering via Bipartite Graph." In Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 2015.

Here are some information about the source of the algorithm
* **ProposedMVSC** is the algorithm proposed in [1].
* **CoregSpectral** is the algorithm proposed in [2]. In fact, it contains two versions of Co-regularized spectral clustering algorithms proposed in [2] as well as a baseline single spectral clustering algorithm.
* **CaiCVPR2011MVSC** is the algorithm proposed in [3].
